# Vai Raja Vai (வை ராஜா வை)

A simple money splitter app for card games played among friends. It takes entries like who won, who pays what, etc.. from each round, and calculates the split-up. Finally it generates gain/loss and who-pays-whom reports for the players.

It is an ad free app requires no internet connectivity and it does n't need access to any of the information from the user's phone.
